                It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing
                and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with
                custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth
                noting that just about any HTML can go within the <a href
                    class="a">.accordion-body</a>, though the transition does
                limit overflow.</p>
